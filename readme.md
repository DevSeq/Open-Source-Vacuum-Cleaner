#Open Source Vacuum Cleaner

Our modern lives are dependent upon proprietary technology which few of us could explain let alone understand how it works.

A growing number of people are reacting to this proprietary technology by building their own devices, so called [Open Source Hardware](http://www.oshwa.org/definition/) (OSHW). This project explores the application of OSHW to the design of every day objects, taking the ubiquitous vacuum cleaner as it's subject.

##About

This project started life because I wanted to explore the use of Open Source Hardware and concepts like [The Makers Bill of Rights](https://gist.github.com/unknowndomain/5082086) and [The Fixer's Manifesto](https://github.com/sugru/manifesto/blob/master/manifesto.md) within the design of every day objects. Looking around the home I realised that the Vacuum Cleaner is one of those products that is fairly expensive, often susceptable to breaking (and expensive repairs), and was electrically much simpler than TVs, Radios and Washing Machines.

###Origin
[I am](http://tomlynch.co.uk/) a [MA Design Interactions](http://www.design-interactions.rca.ac.uk/) student at the [Royal College of Art](http://rca.ac.uk/) (RCA), this is my final project at the RCA.

###Using this project

The on-going work on this project and the decisions that led to the current outcome can be viewed on [my blog](http://unknowndomain.co.uk). This github repository acts as the source of finished files and outcome, the wiki will be where the instructions are documented in the end.
